## Crystals Collector Game
### How the game is played

When the game bigins
    * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
    * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

To play the game:
* The player clicks on one of four different crystals each time. 
* Depending on the cristal clicked, a specific random amount associated with the crystal at the start of each new game is added to the player's total score. 
    ( note: The player does not know the amount associated with each crystal until the player clicks on a given Crystal.) 

* The player's score counter is updated each time a Crystal is clicked.
* The player wins if the total score matches the random number shown at the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if the score goes above the random number shown at the beginning of the game.

The game restarts whenever the player either wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values with all user's score and score counter set to zero.

The app will keep track of the number of games the player wins and loses.
